### Week report 5

This week I finished implementing many things I started last week 
(model import, adding more triangle information to the kd tree, makefile).

I also managed to render something. I decided to first implement
a raycaster without any recursive ray casting and only using one type of materials.
I still need to improve the code for this.

I also spend some time to read about ray tracing and started implementing it
but couldn't finish it yet.

## Next week
I can probably get some version of recursive raytracing working during the 
weekend.

After that I should implement replacements for `std::vector` and
`std::mt19937` / `std::uniform_real_distribution`

I will also try to investigate the structure of the kd trees constructed
with real 3d models.

## Time used:

30 h

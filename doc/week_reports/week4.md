### Week report 4

This week I was busy with other things and didn't produce much new code.
I learned more about how to make makefiles and put the (hopefully) better
version to Develop branch.

I started implementing the 3d model import part but I still don't have 
any functional things ready. I also read texts related to the raycasting
and planned how to do this.

I also realized that the program was functioning in a somewhat wrong way:
Currently the program always returns just a copy of the
triangle ( = three vertices) that was intersected. This alone is not very helpful if the triangles are
also associated with some additional data such as normals/material information.
I started to change this but as it's not functional yet I only put it to the
develop branch.

Time used:

10 h

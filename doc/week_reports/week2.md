    Start implementing the O(n log^2n ) plane finding algorithms
    Draft the stucture of the program
    Implement fast triangle/ray intersection

Mon
    Implement fast ray/voxel intersection algorithm
    6 h

Tue:
    Tried to think about the problem where kd boundary overlaps triangles.
    5 h 

Wed:
    Implement clipping triangles which overlap the
    kd tree split boundary. This was done in a bit naive way
    by representing the triangles as polygons.
    4 h
Wed:
    Added unit tests for geometry routines
    Debugged geometry routines

    5h
Fri:
    Set up code coverage monitoring. 
    Set up a makefile for the geometry.cpp
    Fix compilation errors for kd_tree.cpp. 

    I still have to learn better how to use makefiles.

Future:

    I will write tests for the O(N log^2 N) kd tree construction and 
    kd tree traversal parts.

    After that I can start implementing the faster O(N log N) algorithm.

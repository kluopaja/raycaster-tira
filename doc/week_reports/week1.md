# Week 1

During this week I decided the subject. After this I started reading 
about the topic but I didn't start implementing anything yet. 

I am still a bit worried if the topic is suitable for the course.

Next week I will start thinking about the structure of the program.
I will also set up the code coverage monitoring. I will start
implementing geometry routines and hopefully have a brute-force solution
working.

Time spent: 6 h

## Week report 6

This week I spent quite a lot time implementing the recursive raytracer.

I spent a lot time to read about the physics behind the
raytracing and trying to understand reflectance distribution functions
conservation of energy. 

I also learned about the importance sampling in Monte Carlo integration
which was necessary to reduce the noise.

I added new material properties specular, diffuse, transparency and refractive index.
I still have some problems with the transparency and it's not working correcly.

I started to write the implementation document.

## Future 

I didn't have time to fully fix the issues that were brought up 
in the peer review but I will try to fix them in the future.

As was noted in the new peer review, the documentation for the project
should be improved.

## Time used:

40 h
